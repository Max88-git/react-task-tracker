# React Task Tracker App

In this course project I built a React Task Tracker App using components, props, hooks and state.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Technologies

Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* React 17.0.2

### What I Learnt

* I learnt about what React is and why you would use it. I now know React is a library for building user interfaces (UIs).
* When using React, think of your UI as a bunch of separate components.
* I learnt how to use Create React App to create a React App through the command line to set up my development environment.
* How to use function and class components and create components.
* That Props are arguments passed into React components.
* What JSX is and how JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
* I learnt that stateÂ is just a simple object, that contains key:value pairs. Components use state to manage their data.
* How to use useState hooks and how it lets you add React state to function components.
